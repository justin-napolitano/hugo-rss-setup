# Configuring Hugo RSS Output for Enhanced Feed Metadata

This project addresses the need to augment Hugo's default RSS feed with additional metadata useful for downstream applications, such as a MySQL database ingesting RSS feed data for organization and querying.

## Motivation

The default RSS feed generated by Hugo lacks certain metadata fields that can be critical for advanced feed processing. Specifically, unique identifiers for posts and detailed author information are not included by default. This limits the ability to reliably track and organize feed items in external systems.

## Problem Statement

When consuming RSS feeds, especially in automated workflows, unique and consistent identifiers for posts are essential. Additionally, author metadata enhances the contextual understanding of feed items. Without these, database ingestion and subsequent queries can become unreliable or incomplete.

## Solution Overview

This setup modifies Hugo's RSS template to include:

- A post identifier using Hugo's `.File.UniqueID`, which is a hash of the file path. While not guaranteed unique globally, it suffices for typical use cases.
- Author name and email, conditionally included if defined in the site's parameters.
- A hashed version of the author's email for privacy or identification purposes.

These additions enable downstream systems, such as a MySQL database, to better organize and reference feed data.

## Implementation Details

### RSS Template Modification

The core of the solution is a customized `rss.xml` template placed in `layouts/posts/` within the Hugo project. Key snippets include:

- Adding a post ID:

```xml
<postid>{{ .File.UniqueID }}</postid>
```

- Conditionally adding author name:

```xml
{{ with .Site.Params.author.name }}<author_name>{{ . }}</author_name>{{ end }}
```

- Conditionally adding author email:

```xml
{{ with .Site.Params.author.email }}<author_email>{{ . }}</author_email>{{ end }}
```

- Adding a hashed author ID:

```xml
{{ with .Site.Params.author.email }}<author_id>{{ sha256 . }}</author_id>{{ end }}
```

### Integration Steps

1. Copy the existing RSS template from the theme to your project’s `layouts/posts/` directory.
2. Replace or modify this template with the customized version.
3. Ensure your site’s `config` or `params` includes the author information.
4. Build the site with Hugo to generate the enhanced RSS feed.

## Practical Considerations

- The uniqueness of `.File.UniqueID` depends on file paths and may not be globally unique in all setups. Evaluate if this suffices for your use case.
- The author metadata relies on proper configuration in site parameters.
- Hashing the author email provides a consistent but obfuscated identifier.
